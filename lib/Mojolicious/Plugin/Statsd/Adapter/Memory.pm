=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::Statsd::Adapter::Memory - In-Memory stat recording

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This adapter for L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Statsd> keeps all recorded stats in its
L</stats> attribute and does nothing else.  It's useful for testing.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Mojolicious::Plugin::Statsd::Adapter::Memory
  is a L<Mojo::Base>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 stats

A hashref with a key per stat name recorded.  Currently, counters are scalar
values and timings are hashrefs with 'samples', 'avg, 'min', 'max' keys.  This
isn't meant to keep reliable metrics right now.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 timing

See L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Statsd/timing>.

=head2 counter

See L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Statsd/counter>.
